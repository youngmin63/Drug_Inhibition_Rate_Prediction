## I. Project Goals and Tasks

This project aims to predict CYP3A4 inhibition rates using molecular structure data represented as SMILES, supporting early-stage drug discovery and toxicity screening.
The final solution is based on molecular fingerprint features combined with gradient boosting regression models, selected for their robustness, interpretability, and efficient training.

## II. EDA Summary

The inhibition rate values ranged from 0 to 100 and showed a highly imbalanced distribution, with the majority of compounds exhibiting low to moderate inhibition and relatively few samples with high inhibition rates.

## III. Description of Approach

### Data Preparation

The molecular dataset was cleaned and standardised by validating SMILES strings, removing invalid or duplicate molecules, and aligning inhibition rate values across sources. 
To address data imbalance, particularly the scarcity of high-inhibition compounds, SMILES randomisation was applied to augment samples with inhibition rates above 70%.

### Modelling Approach

The task was formulated as a regression problem.

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

Models were trained using cross-validation and evaluated with MAE and RMSE.

## IV. Results – Inhibition Rate Prediction

Fingerprint-based gradient boosting models showed stable performance under cross-validation, indicating reliable learning behaviour across different data splits. The models generalised well to unseen compounds while maintaining efficient training and inference compared to more complex modelling approaches.

The final selected model achieved a local validation score of approximately 0.82 and a leaderboard score of around 0.77. This model was subsequently used to generate CYP3A4 inhibition rate predictions for previously unseen molecular compounds.

## V. Conclusion

This project demonstrates that molecular fingerprints combined with gradient boosting models can effectively predict CYP3A4 inhibition rates with reliable accuracy.
By focusing on well-established machine learning techniques, the final approach provides a strong and interpretable baseline suitable for practical drug discovery workflows.
